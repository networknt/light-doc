When considering using light-router to assist client that cannot leverage client.jar to access
APIs deployed in the cloud you have two options for deployment artifacts. With each of the 
following option, you have to provide config files and pass them as a directory to the light-router.


### Docker

The docker images can be found at https://hub.docker.com/u/networknt/dashboard/

### Fatjar

The fatjar can be downloaded from maven central with all the dependencies included.
