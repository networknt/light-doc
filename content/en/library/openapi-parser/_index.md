The OpenApi Parser is a Java-based validating parser for OpenAPI 3.0 offering full compliance with the OpenAPI 3.0 Specification, and a highly uniform read/write programming API. OpenAPI, formerly known as the Swagger specification, is the industry-standard format for machine-readable REST API descriptions.

This library is based on the [KaiZen OpenAPI Parser][] with all dependencies and code generator removed. It is green library suitable for microservices and can be used by other projects.
