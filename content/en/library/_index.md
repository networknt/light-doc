While working on Light, we have developed some utility libraries. These libraries are important dependencies of Light; however, they can be used by other projects without using any light-4j frameworks. One of them is json-schema-validator, which is used by a lot of the users and even its own community.

Here, we want to group them together and write down all the documents in order to support these libraries to be used by other projects.

- [json-schema-validator](/library/json-schema-validator/)
- [json-overlay](/library/json-overlay/)
- [openapi-parser](/library/openapi-parser/)
