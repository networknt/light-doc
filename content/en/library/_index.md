While working on the light platform, we have developed some utility libraries. These libraries are important dependencies of the light platform; however, they can be used by other project without using any light-4j frameworks. One of them is json-schema-validator which is used by a lot of the users and it has its own community. 

Here we want to group them together and write down all the document in order to support these library to be used by other projects. 

- [json-schema-validator](/library/json-schema-validator/)
- [json-overlay](/library/json-overlay/)
- [openapi-parser](/library/openapi-parser/)
