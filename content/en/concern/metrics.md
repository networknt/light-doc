## Introduction

Metrics handler collects the API runtime information and report to Influxdb periodically 
(5 minutes to 15 minutes based on the volume of the API). A Grafana instance is hooked to Influxdb
to output the metrics on dashboard from two different perspectives:
 
* Client oriented - client centric info to show how many APIs to call and each API runtime info.

* API oriented - API centric info to show how many clients is calling this API.

## Configuration

Here is an example of configuration.

```
# Metrics handler configuration

# If metrics handler is enabled or not
enabled: false

# influxdb protocal can be http, https
influxdbProtocol: http
# influxdb hostname
influxdbHost: localhost
# influxdb port number
influxdbPort: 8086
# influxdb database name
influxdbName: metrics
# influxdb user
influxdbUser: admin
# influx db password
influxdbPass: admin
# report and reset metrics in minutes.
reportInMinutes: 1
```

## InfluxDB and Grafana

Here is the docker-compose.yml

```
influxdb:
  image: influxdb:latest
  container_name: influxdb
  ports:
    - "8083:8083"
    - "8086:8086"

grafana:
  image: grafana/grafana:latest
  container_name: grafana
  ports:
    - "3000:3000"
  links:
    - influxdb
```

## Metrics Collected

![measurements](/images/measurements.png)

As you can see, there two perspectives in collecting metrics info. The measurements started with clientId are client
centric info and the measurements started with API name are API centric info.

Currently, we are collecting 5 metrics each.


![client metrics](/images/client_metrics.png)

This is request count for client f7d42348-c647-4efb-a52d-4c5787421e72

The first column is timestamp and value column is the value for this time series. Other columns are tags and they
are endpoint, hostname/container id, ipAddress and version.


![api metrics](/images/api_metrics.png)

This is request count for API swagger_petstore.

The first column is timestamp and value column is the value for this time series. Other columns are tags and they
are endpoint, hostname/container id, ipAddress and version.


## Customization

The default implementation is based on InfluxDB and Grafana which are the most popular combination
for docker containers. However, the database and dashboard can be replaced easily with another
reporter implementation. To replace it, change the MetricsHandler to use another reporter instead of
InfluxDB.

## reportInMinutes

In the metrics.yml, you can choose reportInMinutes. This is a period the system caches and 
calculates statistic info about the request/response and report to the Influxdb. After the
report, the data set is reset so that the collection is started from scratch again. Depending
on the performance requirement for your services and your capacity of influxdb, you may choose
long report period or short report period. Short period like 5 minutes will generate more
traffic and data to influxdb but reduce the chance of data loss when server is restarting.
Long period like 15 minutes will reduce the load to influxdb and you can keep more days data
online in influxdb to study the long term trends of your services.
