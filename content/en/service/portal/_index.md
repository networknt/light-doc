Light-portal is a set of services for consumer and provider runtime management and marketplace to bridge the gap between consumers and providers. When you build microservices on a large scale on top of light-4j and related frameworks, you need a portal service to manage the entire life-cycle of your services and to provide a marketplace for bridging API consumers and API providers. We have explored the open-source projects on github.com and could not find any existing product that meets our requirement, so we decided to build it on top of the light-4j framework.

In the long run, we will be deploying the infrastructure services to the cloud along with light-portal to serve small and medium-sized organizations at https://lightapi.net. All services in the portal support multi-tenancy, so all users will be grouped based on the host selected during the [user registration][] on the portal.

We will also set up a dev/test environment in parallel with https://lightapi.net called https://dev.lightapi.net for developers and testers. All-new UI components and services will be deployed here to test and then move to the production site. This site is also free for all users to access and test the functionality of their services during the development. 

For some organizations that want to have their domain name and customized portal UI, the light-router who serves the portal UI supports [virtual host][]. In fact, https://lightapi.net is just one of the virtual hosts along with https://demo.taiji.io, https://faucet.taiji.io, and https://taiji.io on the same light-router instance. You can check the IP address for the above sites. With a virtual host, it would be very easy to have your portal site like https://portal.example.com with your company's customized UI style. 

The open-sourced portal-view gives all developers a chance to custom or style the portal UI freely. We encourage partners to white-label the light-portal services with customized UI with their brand and sell the subscriptions to their customers. 

We will also package the services and UI as an enterprise edition for large organizations to install on their private or public cloud. We will charge a yearly subscription fee to allow users to use the software and provide commercial support for customers. 

The portal services can be found at [light-portal](https://github.com/networknt/light-portal), and it is only open-sourced to paid customers. However, the portal's UI is open-sourced to the public at [portal-view](https://github.com/networknt/portal-view). 

As we are aiming light-portal as a cloud service, it needs to scale for the Internet volume. Please visit [technology stack][] for the non-functional requirement and frameworks for both back-end services and front-end UI.
