When you go to https://lightapi.net, the landing page is the dashboard. On the upper right corner, there is a user icon. Click it, and you will find two menus: Sign In and Sign Up.

To register a new user, click the Sign Up on th menu. A user profile form will be shown up. 

By default, the host is lightapi.net, and you can change it later in your profile after requesting a new host that matches your registered email.

If you just want to use the site and all sister sites as a normal user, you can use your personal email. If you want to create a brand new host, you have to use your corporate email, and the email domain can be used to request a new host. 

A userId is a unique identifier, and it can be used for communication without revealing your email address. 

Password and PasswordConfirm must be the same, and it should be a strong one so that nobody can guess it.

First name, Last Name and Gender are general information about the user, and they are mandatory.

If you have Taiji Wallet Address, you can enter it. The currency can pay the light-portal subscription and all the hosted services, and users can earn it by contributing to the projects. 

The country, province and city dropdowns are populated dynamically from the light-reference from the light-portal. If you are using https://maproot.net, then you should fill in these fields. Currently, we have Canada and US populated in the country dropdown. If your city is not populated, you can select the capital city of the province or state. 

After clicking the SIGNUP button, a successful page will be shown up if there is no error. If there is an error, an error page should be shown up. 

After the signup, a confirmation email will be sent out. Please double-check the spam folder if you cannot find it in your inbox. 

In the confirmation email, there is a link. Once you click the link, a light-portal API will be invoked to confirm the registration. After the email confirmation, you can click the Sign In button to log in.
