The Kafka sidecar is designed to address the following concerns for distributed microservices to leverage asynchronous event-based communications instead of synchronous request/response over HTTP. 

* Hide the complicity of Kafka client

Unlike traditional server-heavy messaging systems, Kafka's server is just a set of appended logs; however, the Kafka client is much more complicated. It is not an easy task to build a producer or consumer in microservices within a multi-threaded context. 

* Address asynchronous cross-cutting concerns

The sidecar will have middleware handlers in the request/response chain to address cross-cutting concerns, just like the light-proxy sidecar for the backend APIs. For example, the correlationId or tracerId can be injected into the message headers with the sidecar producer to propagate to downstream APIs with the sidecar consumer. 

* Easy to upgrade for new features and security vulnerabilities

There are many dependencies for Kafka and Confluent components on the client-side, and there are upgraded frequently to match the server-side version upgrade. Instead of updating all microservices to leverage the new server-side features or resolve security vulnerabilities, we can upgrade the sidecar and deploy it. 

* Support multiple languages and frameworks for APIs

Kafka client is complicated, and only the Java version is in sync with the server upgrades. The other best version that Confluent Inc. supports is the C++ version, and a lot of languages depend on it with a wrapper. There are several open-source clients for some languages, but they are always behind the server upgrades with minimum supports. With the sidecar, developers can choose any language or framework to build their APIs.
 
The goal is to allow the developers to focus on their APIs' business logic instead of the specific Kafka client API and cross-cutting concerns.

## Why Kafka-sidecar

When implementing an application that interacts with Kafka, there are pros and cons to using a sidecar vs a standalone app. 

### Kafka Sidecar

Pros:

* The Kafka Sidecar only needs to deal with one backend with fixed IP and port. Easy to implement.

* Low latency as it is in the same pod as backend API

* Easy to evolve/upgrade per backend API

* Offers the most flexibility

* It becomes part of the backend API, ie, the backend API and the Kafka Sidecar form together the Event Producer and consumer, one logical unit:

* It has its own identity and will be easy to manage as such when interacting with Kafka.

* It will authenticate its consumers via Oauth and expose a contract via an OpenAPI Specifications, and will authenticate itself with Kafka with LDAP integration, authorize via RBAC and will only be allow to interact with the topic that it has access to.

* All of the traceability and auditing on the Kafka out of the box components will be tied to that identity

* We will be able to use the Kafka Sidecar to observe that logical entity, having heath checks on the sidecar that will make it all the way to the backend API

 
Cons:


* Extra cost as sidecar will use resource.

* Make the delivery pipeline complicated to deal with an extra container in the pod.


### Standalone

Pros:

* Lower the cost as one instance can be shared with multiple backend services. 

* No need to change the pipeline as it is deployed just like another service.

Cons:

* The Kafka Service needs to deal with multiple backend and manage them with subscribe / unsubscribe API. Also, it needs to manage the state/cache for each instance. Hard to implement.

* Any update to the service need to consider the impacts for all backend services. 

* Becomes a single point of failure for the backend APIs that it serves

* The Kafka service now has a separate identity then  the Backend APIs that it serves and all action on the Kafka will be tracked as being done by the Kafka Service on the out of the box confluent audit trails.

* The Kafka service functional id will now have a broad set of permissions and as such expands the surface of exposure in case of a breach

* Authentication and Authorization of interactions between between Kafka Service and backend APIs will be complex and hard to manage:

* backend APIs will need to authenticate with the Kafka service via Oauth to produce to Kafka and to register as a Consumer of events

* Kafka Service will have to authenticate with backend API via Oauth to push events to it


## Functional Component

### Kafka Producer

[Kafka Producer][] has an endpoint that allows backend API/APP to invoke to produce messages to one or more Kafka topics. To avoid each request to access the schema registry for the serialize the key and value, we can pass the schemaId or versionId to [cache the schema][] for the producer. When producing a record from the Kafka sidecar, one can also pass in a [traceabilityId][] in the ProduceRecord. This id will be propagated to all the applications this message is involved in for end-to-end tracing.  


### Active Consumer

[Kafka Active Consumer] has some endpoints to allow backend API/APP to create an instance, subscribe and retrieve records actively. When using this consumer, the backend API/APP has complete control of consuming the Kafka topic(s).

### Reactive Consumer

[Kafka Reactive Consumer][] will automatically poll the Kafka topic(s) on the sidecar and invoke an API endpoint on the back-end API/APP once messages are available based on the configuration. It has several endpoints to allow the light-controller to seek the offset if necessary. 

### KsqlDB Consumer

[Kafka KsqlDB Consumer][] will automatically subscribe from the KsqlDB server with a query during the server startup and callback to the backend API/App when records are received. 

### Kafka Streams

[Kafka Streams][] allows the users to develop and deploy the stream processor on the Kafka sidecar with the backend API exposes endpoints to receive the notification or the processed result. This component is working in progress. 

## Control Pane Administration

When using the Kafka Producer and Active Consumer, the backend API has full control over the producer and consumer; however, other consumers and streams are working reactively on the sidecar. The backend API will passively receive the post requests from the sidecar. If we want to update the consumer states for each consumer instance, we can leverage the control pane to access the sidecar's admin API. For example, if we want to replay events from a specific offset. For more info, please visit [Kafka Sidecar Admin][]

## Cross-cutting Concerns

One of the main goals for the Kafka sidecar is to address [cross-cutting concerns][] for asynchronous events consistently. The following non-functional concerns are address in the sidecar. 

* HTTP Request validation with OpenAPI 3.0 specification and schema validation and serialization with Confluent schema registry. 
* Propagate light-4j correlationId/traceabilityId or open tracing tracerId to the downstream service through Kafka record headers. 
* Inject correlationId/traceabilityId/tracerId to the MDC for logging statements and update logging level for sidecar packages from the control pane during runtime.
* Metrics collection on both client and service perspectives and integration with InfluxDB or enterprise metrics tools.
* The sidecar connects to the Kafka with authentication and authorization over TLS and only allow the connection from the same pod with localhost for HTTP requests.
* Sidecar auditing activities are sent to a Kafka topic through the producer and subsequently can be streams to a database for query with Confluent connect.
* Dead letter queue to handle the situation that the backend API cannot process the corrupted record successfully due to runtime exceptions. The problematic records will be pushed to a dead letter topic for future processing once the backend API is fixed and redeployed. 

## Format

The Kafka Sidecar supports the following format in the configuration for both key and value. 

```
            - binary
            - avro
            - json
            - jsonschema
            - protobuf
            - string

```

And there is a Enum class that defines the enum values at [EmbeddedFormat.java](https://github.com/networknt/light-kafka/blob/master/kafka-entity/src/main/java/com/networknt/kafka/entity/EmbeddedFormat.java)

The corresponding values for the above format in enum values should be

```
0
1
2
3
4
5
```

#### binary

When users produce small binary audio and video streams to a Kafka topic, you can use the base64 to encode the binary data on the backend and send it to the Kafka sidecar. When the keyFormat or valueFormat is defined as binary in the kafka-producer.yml, the sidecar will decode the key or value based on the binary configuration and save the decoded byte[] to the Kafka topic. This will significantly reduce the size of the key or value (average 33% reduction). Also, saving the binary data as the original gives third-party consumers direct access to the binary from the topic. 


Please be aware that the binary format is normally used on value only, and it is not a good idea to save large binary data to Kafka. For example, by default, Kafka producer can only accept up to 1MB per message, and if you have audio or video streams larger than 1MB, you should save the content to a filesystem or S3 and only push the location to the Kafka. 

For testing, you can use the this [site](https://codebeautify.org/base64-encode) to encode and decode between String to Base64 and Base64 to String. 


Given we have topic test6 created without any schema for the key and value, here is a test reqeust with keyFormat string and valueFormat binary 

```
curl -k --location --request POST 'https://localhost:8443/producers/test6' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"records":[{"key":"alice","value":"YWJj"},{"key":"john","value":"ZGVm"},{"key":"alex","value":"eHl6"}]}'

```

In the kafka-producer.yml, we should have the following config for the keyFormat and valueFormat.

```
# Default key format if no schema for the topic key
keyFormat: ${kafka-producer.keyFormat:string}
# Default value format if no schema for the topic value
valueFormat: ${kafka-producer.valueFormat:binary}

```

If a consumer is used, then we need to have the following config in the kafka-consumer.yml

```

topic: ${kafka-consumer.topic:test6}
# the format of the key optional
keyFormat: ${kafka-consumer.keyFormat:string}
# the format of the value optional
valueFormat: ${kafka-consumer.valueFormat:binary}

```

For the same test6 topic, we can switch the format between the key and value so that the keyFormat is binary and valueFormat is string. Here is the test request. 

```
curl -k --location --request POST 'https://localhost:8443/producers/test6' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"records":[{"key":"YWxpY2U=","value":"abc"},{"key":"am9obg==","value":"def"},{"key":"YWxleA==","value":"xyz"}]}'

```

For the above curl command to work with the Kafka sidecar, we need to change the configuration for producer and consumer. This time, we are going to update the values.yml 

```
kafka-producer.keyFormat: binary
kafka-producer.valueFormat: string

kafka-consumer.keyFormat: binary
kafka-consumer.valueFormat: string

```

## Admin Endpoints

Like other light-4j services, we have injected admin endpoints for it to integrate with Light Control Plane. For server info, chaos monkey and logger config, they are standard. However, the health check for the Kafka sidecar is a customized one. 

### Health Check

The Kafka sidecar connects to the Kafka cluster and potentially backend API if Reactive Consumer is enabled. For the health check, we iterate the startup hooks and check the following:

* If the producer is enabled, then we need to check if the ProducerStartupHook.producer to see if it is created successfully. 

* If the reactive consumer is enabled, we need to check if the ReactiveConsumerStartupHook.kafkaConsumerManager is created successfully. Also, we need to check if we can send a health check request to the backend to ensure the connection to the backend. 

The backend health check is disabled by defautl and can be enabled with the following health.yml config file. 


```
# Server health endpoint that can output OK to indicate the server is alive

# true to enable this middleware handler. By default the health check is enabled.
enabled: ${health.enabled:true}
# true to return Json format message. By default, it is false. It will only be changed to true if the monitor
# tool only support JSON response body.
useJson: ${health.useJson:false}
# timeout in milliseconds for the health check. If the duration is passed, a failure will return.
# It is to prevent taking too much time to check subsystems that are not available or timeout.
# As the health check is used by the control plane for service discovery, by default, one request
# per ten seconds. The quick response time is very important to not block the control plane.
timeout: ${health.timeout:500}

# For some of the services like light-proxy, http-sidecar and kafka-sidecar, we might need to check the down
# stream API before return the health status to the invoker. By default it is not enabled.

# if the health check needs to invoke down streams API. It is false by default.
downstreamEnabled: ${health.downstreamEnabled:true}
# down stream API host. http://localhost is the default when used with http-sidecar and kafka-sidecar.
downstreamHost: ${health.downstreamHost:http://localhost}
# down stream API health check path. This allows the down stream API to have customized path implemented.
downstreamPath: ${health.downstreamPath:/health}

```

If you are using frameworks other than light-4j for the backend implementation, you can customize the downstreamPath if necessary.


## Deployment

When deploying the Kafka Sidecar to a Kubernetes cluster, we need to allocate more memory for the container because Kafka uses more memory when producing and consuming records. 

```
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 1024Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 250m
    memory: 768Mi  
```

Also, set the Java command line memory options as an environment variable or in the command line in Dockerfile.

```
env:
  -name: JVM_OPTS
  value: -Xmx768m -Xms960m
```

## Performance

When using the Kafka sidecar to interact with Kafka Cluster, the Kafka Client will be wrapped by the sidecar. The backend API will not have any dependencies on Kafka libraries. As we know, the Kafka client is CPU and memory heavy due to the cache. 

### Producer
For the producer, we need to control the size of the request body to be smaller than 1MB. If you have too many messages to be sent to Kafka, divide them into smaller sizes and send multiple requests. 

Depending on the size of the message, we recmmend sending hundreds or thousands of messages each batch, and the total size is smaller than 1MB. 

If you have a smaller message size, the batch size should be smaller as the number of messages in the batch will impact the throughput dramatically. With more messages in the batch, Kafka Sidecar has to divide them into several Kafka batches and write the audit in the same handler. It requires more memory and CPU power. Also, the Jackson parser is getting slower when there are too many small objects in a JSON array than fewer bigger objects in a JSON array when both JSON are about the same size. 

If you have some special case that one message that is bigger than 1MB (should be very rare), then you need to update the server.yml to all light-4j to accept requests bigger than 1MB. 

```
# Set the max transfer file size for uploading files—default to 1000000, which is 1 MB.
# maxTransferFileSize: ${server.maxTransferFileSize:1000000}
```

### Reactive Consumer

For each reactive consumer application, we need to carefully design the batch size to reach the optimal performance in terms of throughput and CPU/memory usage. 

The bigger the batch size, the better throughput to consume more messages in a short time. However, more memory and more CPU power 
will be utilized when the batch size is increased. 

When tuning the performance for the Reactive Consumer, we need to consider the following factors. 

##### Batch Size

It is configurable in the kafka-consumer.yml, and the default value is 100K. With an average record size of 1KB, a batch will contain about 100 messages. We need to ensure this size is bigger than the fetch.max.bytes so that one poll from Kafka can be sent to the backend in one batch without leftover. 

```
# maximum number of bytes message keys and values returned. Default to 200*1024
requestMaxBytes: ${kafka-consumer.requestMaxBytes:204800}
```

##### Record Size

When the backend is consuming the messages, each message will take some time. The more messages in the batch, the more time is needed to process the entire batch. If the record size is smaller, please make sure the batch size is smaller so that the backend won't be overloaded. In general, we should make sure each batch only container about 100 records.

##### Backend Processing Time

How long will it take for the backend to process each record will impact the performance and the design for the batch size. Depending on the business logic, we need to ensure the entire processing time to be limited to 20 to 30 seconds. The average processing time should be used to design the batch size along with the record size. 

##### fetch.max.bytes

Once we decided on the requestMaxBytes, we need to adjust several Kafka properties to make sure that the polling from Kafka is more efficient. As we don't want to cache more data on the sidecar, we want to make sure that the fetch.max.bytes are just about the requestMaxBytes. 

```
  # max fetch size from Kafka cluster. Default 50mb is too big for cache consumption on the sidecar
  fetch.max.bytes: ${kafka-consumer.fetch.max.bytes:102400}

```

##### max.poll.records

This Kafka property gives us more control over the Kafka consumer. The default value is 100, and it should be adjusted based on the record size and the batch size. 

```
  # max pol records default is 500. Adjust it based on the size of the records to make sure each poll
  # is similar to requestMaxBytes down below.
  max.poll.records: ${kafka-consumer.max.poll.records:100}

```

##### max.partition.fetch.bytes

This property is similar to the` fetch.max.bytes` but it is defined on the partition level. The value should be the same as the `fetch.max.bytes`, which in line with the requestMaxBytes. 

```
  # The maximum amount of data per-partition the server will return. Records are fetched in batches by the consumer.
  # If the first record batch in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than this limit, the batch will still be returned to ensure that the consumer can make progress.
  max.partition.fetch.bytes: ${kafka-consumer.max.partition.fetch.bytes:102400}
```

### TroubleShooting

##### Group Rebalancing

If you see the following INFO from the log, that means your batch size is too big to handle within a reasonable period. 

```
Attempt to heartbeat failed since group is rebalancing
```

The `kakfa max.poll.interval.ms` is the maximum delay between invocations of poll() when using consumer group management. This places an upper bound on the amount of time that the consumer can be idle before fetching more records. Suppose poll() is not called before the expiration of this timeout. In that case, the consumer is considered failed, and the group will rebalance in order to reassign the partitions to another member. For consumers using a non-null group.instance.id which reach this timeout, partitions will not be immediately reassigned. Instead, the consumer will stop sending heartbeats, and partitions will be reassigned after the expiration of the session.timeout.ms. This mirrors the behaviour of a static consumer which has shut down. The default value for this config property is 300000 (5 minutes) and we need to ensure we poll records from Kafka within 5 minute. 

As you know, we poll a batch from Kafka and send it to the backend API for consuming (processing). Once the backend processes all the records in the batch, it returns a response to the sidecar and the sidecar will poll from Kafka again for another batch and send to the backend again. If the backend processing is slow and more prolonged than 5 minutes, then the heartbeat failure will be sent from the sidecar instance. Even the backend processing is faster, we might still trigger this problem if the batch size of the Kafka poll is bigger than the batch size we send to the backend API. This means one Kafka poll is split into multiple backend API calls and potentially makes the next poll() delayed over 5 minutes. This is why we recommend the Kafka `fetch.max.bytes` is smaller than the `requestMaxBytes`. 

When you see the above errors in the log, you will eventually see the following error to indicate that the Kafka sidecar is kicked out of the consumer group. 

```
Member xxx sending LeaveGroup request to coordinator xxx due to consumer poll timeout has expired. This means the time between subsequent calls to poll() was longer than the configured `max.poll.interval.ms`, which typically implies that the poll loop is spending too much time processing messages. You can address this either by increasing max.poll.interval.ms or by reducing the maximum size of batches returned in poll() with `max.poll.records`.
```

We don't recommend increasing the max.poll.interval.ms but to reduce the size of the batch with the `fetch.max.bytes`.

After the rebalancing, the partition is not assigned to the current consumer. The normal response from the backend cannot commit the offset anymore. So you might have this error in the log. 

```
Offset commit cannot be completed since the consumer is not part of an active group for auto partition assignment; it is likely that the consumer was kicked out of the group. 
```

Since the batch cannot be committed and the partition has migrated to another instance, the same batch will be consumed from another instance. With the idempotent backend, this is not an issue. However, we need to reduce the size of the batch to get the root cause resolved.
