Refresh Token is issued in Authorization Code Grant and Resource Owner Password Credentials 
Grant along with access token. Also, for maximum security, a refresh token is issued every
time the old refresh token is used to renew an access token. The token service is responsible
for issuing refresh token alone with access token. This service is used to manage the refresh
token. For example, all all active refresh tokens, delete/revoke a refresh token or retrieve
all information about one particular refresh token.   


This service is listening to port number 6886.

### /oauth2/refresh_token@get

This endpoint gets all the issued refresh tokens with filter and sorted on 
userId. A page query parameter is mandatory. pageSize and userId filter
are optional.

* page 

Page number which must be specified. It starts with 1 and an empty list will
be returned if the page is greater than the last page.

* pageSize

Default pageSize is 10 and you can overwrite it with another number. Please don't
use a big number due to performance reason. 

* userId

This is the only filter available and it supports filter by start with a few characters.
For example, "userId=abc" means any userId starts with "abc". The result is also
sorted by userId in the pagination.
