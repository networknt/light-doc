This is a service for user registration and management. The OAuth server supports
integration with other user management system like active directory or LDAP.
However, for most enterprise customers, their customer information normally will
be in database. This service provides a database table for user management and
several endpoints to manage users. 

In OAuth 2.0 specification, user is normally called resource owner. 

### User Type

Currently there are three user types to support. 

* customer
* partner
* employee

### User Id

User id must be unique within the system.

### Password

Password is provided when registering and it is hashed and salted in persistence
layer. 

### User Micro Service

This service has several endpoints and listening to port 6885.

Here is the specification.
