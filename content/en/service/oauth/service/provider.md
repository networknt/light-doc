The service to support federated OAuth 2.0 providers.

For example, external OAuth 2.0 provider for external clients and internal OAuth 2.0 provider for internal clients.


 It is a federation protocol aimed at simplifying authorization and access to protected data by giving access to data while protecting the ownerâ€™s account credentials.
 It allows a user with an account on one website (the service provider) to allow another website (the consumer) to access his or her data from the first website.



This service has several endpoints and listens to port 6889.
