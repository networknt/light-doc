Every micro service or API needs to register itself to OAuth2 server in order to control who
can access it. During the registration/on-boarding, a list of scopes defined in the OpenAPI
specification or other schema contracts for GraphQL and Hybrid RPC should be populated as well. 
This list of scopes will be used for client to register scopes in order to access this particular 
service or API during client registration. 

This service has several endpoints and listens to port 6883.

### /oauth2/service@get

This endpoint gets all the services from service with filter and sorted on 
serviceId. A page query parameter is mandatory and pageSize and serviceId filter
are optional.

* page 

Page number which must be specified. It starts with 1 and an empty list will
be returned if the page is greater than the last page.

* pageSize

Default pageSize is 10 and you can overwrite it with another number. Please don't
use a big number due to performance reason. 

* serviceId

This is the only filter available and it supports filter by start with a few characters.
For example, "serviceId=abc" means any serviceId starts with "abc". The result is also
sorted by serviceId in the pagination. 


The following validation will be performed in the service.

* If page is missing from the query parameter, an error will be returned.

```
  "ERR11000": {
    "statusCode": 400,
    "code": "ERR11000",
    "message": "VALIDATOR_REQUEST_PARAMETER_QUERY_MISSING",
    "description": "Query parameter '%s' is required on path '%s' but not found in request."
  }
```

### /oauth2/service@post

This endpoint is used to create a new service. The following validation will be performed
before a new service is created.

* If serviceId exists in the cache, then the following error will be returned.

```
  "ERR12018": {
    "statusCode": 400,
    "code": "ERR12018",
    "message": "SERVICE_ID_EXISTS",
    "description": "Service id %s exists."
  }
```

* If ownerId doesn't exist in user cache, then the following error will be returned.

```
  "ERR12013": {
    "statusCode": 404,
    "code": "ERR12013",
    "message": "USER_NOT_FOUND",
    "description": "User %s is not found."
  }
```


### /oauth2/service@put

This is the endpoint to update existing service. Before service is updated, the
following validation will be performed.

* If serviceId cannot be found in the service cache, then the following error will be
returned.

```
  "ERR12015": {
    "statusCode": 404,
    "code": "ERR12015",
    "message": "SERVICE_NOT_FOUND",
    "description": "Service %s is not found."
  }
```

* If ownerId doesn't exist in user cache, then the following error will be returned.

```
  "ERR12013": {
    "statusCode": 404,
    "code": "ERR12013",
    "message": "USER_NOT_FOUND",
    "description": "User %s is not found."
  }
```

### /oauth2/service/{serviceId}@delete

This endpoint is used to delete existing service. Before the service is deleted,
the following validations will be performed.

* If serviceId cannot be found in the service cache, then the following error will be
returned.

```
  "ERR12015": {
    "statusCode": 404,
    "code": "ERR12015",
    "message": "SERVICE_NOT_FOUND",
    "description": "Service %s is not found."
  }
```

### /oauth2/service/{serviceId}@get

This endpoint is used to get a particular service by serviceId. Before the service is
returned, the following validation will be performed.

* If serviceId cannot be found in the service cache, then the following error will be
returned.

```
  "ERR12015": {
    "statusCode": 404,
    "code": "ERR12015",
    "message": "SERVICE_NOT_FOUND",
    "description": "Service %s is not found."
  }
```

### /oauth2/service/{serviceId}/endpoint@post

This is an endpoint that is used to register endpoints for a particular service. As you can
see there is no put method for this resource so all endpoints will be deleted and then insert
if this endpoint is called. 

Here is an example of request body.

```json
[{"endpoint":"/v1/data@post","operation":"createData","scope":"data.w"},{"endpoint":"/v1/data@put","operation":"updateData","scope":"data.w"},{"endpoint":"/v1/data@get","operation":"retrieveData","scope":"data.r"},{"endpoint":"/v1/data@delete","operation":"deleteData","scope":"data.w"}]
```

* If serviceId cannot be found in the service cache, then the following error will be
returned.

```
  "ERR12015": {
    "statusCode": 404,
    "code": "ERR12015",
    "message": "SERVICE_NOT_FOUND",
    "description": "Service %s is not found."
  }
```

### /oauth2/service/{serviceId}/endpoint@delete

This is an endpoint that is used to delete all the endpoints for a particular service. You
have to make sure that there is no client links to the service endpoints before issuing
delete request. Otherwise, you will have database constraint error. 

* If service endpoints cannot be found in the service cache, then the following error will be
returned.

```
  "ERR12015": {
    "statusCode": 404,
    "code": "ERR12042",
    "message": "SERVICE_ENDPOINT_NOT_FOUND",
    "description": "Service %s is not found."
  }
```


### /oauth2/service/{serviceId}/endpoint@get

This is an endpoint that is used to get all the endpoints for a particular service. 

Here is an example of response body

```json
[{"factoryId":5,"id":5,"operation":"retrieve data","endpoint":"/v1/getData@get","scope":"data.r"},{"factoryId":5,"id":5,"operation":"create data","endpoint":"/v1/postData@post","scope":"data.w"}]
```

* If service endpoints cannot be found in the service cache, then the following error will be
returned.

```
  "ERR12015": {
    "statusCode": 404,
    "code": "ERR12042",
    "message": "SERVICE_ENDPOINT_NOT_FOUND",
    "description": "Service %s is not found."
