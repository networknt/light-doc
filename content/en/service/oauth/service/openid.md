OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication layer on top of OAuth 2.0, an authorization framework. The 
standard is controlled by the OpenID Foundation. 

OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which allows computing 
clients to verify the identity of an end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization 
server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like 
manner. In technical terms, OpenID Connect specifies a RESTful HTTP API, using JSON as a data format.

OpenID Connect allows a range of clients, including Web-based, mobile, and JavaScript clients, to request 
and receive information about authenticated sessions and end-users. The specification suite is extensible, 
supporting optional features such as encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID Providers, and session 
management.
