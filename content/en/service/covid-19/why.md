It seems that the entire world is locked down, and nobody knows when the situation will return to normal. Even we can reopen the country next month, we still need social distancing until the vaccine for COVID-19 is available. For the majority of people, they have to change their lifestyles; however, for some vulnerable people, it is about survival. 

I have heard people who had returned from another country forced to be self-isolated at home without food, and online order would be delivered two weeks later. Wouldn't it be wonderful if a neighbor can shop more at the grocery and drop it at the door?

I have seen people waiting at the local Costco for hours in the morning to get in. Wouldn't it be better for a Costco employee to publish the waiting time on a website so that shoppers can decide when to go there?

Our government is helping poor people with financial aid; our doctors and nurses are fighting at the front line. We, as a community, need to be united, help each other, and grow stronger. To connect people in the same neighborhood, I have been working on an application in the last two weeks. 

Since early this year, we had shifted the development from frameworks to the light-portal , which is a service in the light platform to bring the providers and consumers together. When entire Canada was locked down several weeks ago, we decided to change our focus to the COVID-19 application instead. It needs some features that we can leverage directly from the light-portal, and a lot of services can be used in the future for the portal as well. If the app can help people, then it worth the effort. 

With several weeks of hard work, we have deployed the testing instance on our test server. We hope you can try it out and make recommendations for improvement. Let's work together as a community to bring this application alive.
