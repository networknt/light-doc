When considering using light-proxy to wrap your existing API, you have two options for
deployment artifacts. With each of the following option, you have to provide config 
files and pass them as a directory to the light-proxy.


### Docker

The docker images can be found at https://hub.docker.com/u/networknt/dashboard/

### Fatjar

The fatjar can be downloaded from maven central with all the dependencies included.
