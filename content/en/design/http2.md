There are several benefits to using HTTP/2 instead of HTTP/1.x in microservices architecture.

### HTTP/2 is Binary, Instead of Textual

### HTTP/2 is Fully Multiplexed, Instead of Ordered and Blocking

### HTTP/2 Can Use One Connection for Parallelism

### HTTP/2 Users Header Compression to Reduce Overhead

### HTTP/2 Allows Servers to Push Responses Proactively into Client Caches

Please read this [article][] that explains HTTP/2 benefits for microservices.
