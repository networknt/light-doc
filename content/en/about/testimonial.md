* I played with most performance frameworks in top 10 in techempower.com, I can conclude that Light-4j should be in top 3-8 ranks by its own power and some tuning tip-tricks. But I and other guys should pay a great thanks to you for full security implementation, modern architecture&design patterns, my best TCO system on production etc. beside performance. Thanks much! -@PeterKieu


* We are a very early stage startup - with a primary backend built entirely on light-4j, deployed on GKE. -@debanshu
