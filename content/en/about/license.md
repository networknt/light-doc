### Commerical License

Some of the private commercial components have dependencies on proprietary libraries; however, customers who are using these commercial components already have the proper licenses. For example, we have a private project light-mq for IBM MQ integration, which depends on the MQ java client.  We assume that customers who are using light-mq have the proper license from IBM.
