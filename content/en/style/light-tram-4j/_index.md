The foundation of the Service Broker programming model is transactional messaging. Any operation that 
involves Service Broker is part of the current transaction. Service Broker does not commit a messaging 
operation until the current transaction commits. If the transaction rolls back, the Database Engine 
guarantees that all messaging operations that are part of the transaction also roll back. An application 
manages messaging operations as part of managing SQL Server transactions.

For example, when a program sends a message within a transaction, Service Broker does not send the message 
over the network until the program commits the transaction. When a program receives a message within a 
transaction, the Database Engine does not permanently remove the message from the queue until the program 
commits the transaction.

Transactional messaging helps you write robust, scalable applications by ensuring that the state of the 
database remains consistent with the state of the queues. When an application makes a change to the 
database and sends or receives a message, the change to the database and the messaging operation are 
part of the same transaction. If the transaction rolls back, both the change to the database and the 
messaging operation roll back. Both operations succeed, or both operations fail. In the Service Broker 
model, an application uses transactional messaging to guarantee that the messages sent by the application 
reflect the current state of the database.

To take full advantage of transactional messaging, you write your applications so that messaging operations 
occur in the same transaction as the database operations that the messages represent. For example, an 
application that processes an order receives the message for the order and updates the database with the 
order in a single transaction.

If the application instead receives the message in one transaction and updates the database in a different 
transaction, a failure to update the database creates a situation where the message no longer exists but the 
change that the message requested has not taken place. In this case, the application does not take advantage 
of one of the main benefits that Service Broker provides. In particular, Service Broker guarantees that all 
messages are delivered exactly once, in order, or else the message sender is notified with a Service Broker 
error message. An application that removes a message from the queue permanently, but fails to process the 
message, as in this example, breaks this guarantee. Without this guarantee, the application must contain 
additional code to handle possible inconsistencies or run the risk of incorrect results.

When an application processes a message and makes no changes to the database, the guarantee holds. The message 
has been processed successfully. An application that uses Service Broker may choose to ignore a message, but 
the application must not inadvertently lose a message, even in cases where the application loses connectivity 
to the database or exits unexpectedly.
