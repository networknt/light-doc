Most people think that light-4j and related frameworks are API frameworks and can only build different styles of APIs or microservices. In fact, light-4j is a very fast web server that is optimized to serve static content and single page applications built with Angular, React or Vue. Also, the web server supports [distributed session][]  with Hazelcast, Redis or SQL database.
