The light-eventuate-4j framework is a service mesh infrastructure that provide messaging
and Event Sourcing/CQRS. 


If you are a developer that working on microservices built with 
light-rest-4j/light-graphql-4j/light-hybrid-4j and want to leverage light-eventuate-4j for ES/CQRS,
then you can start the light-eventuate-4j services with docker-compose in light-docker.

For details steps, please refer to [light-eventuate-4j getting started][]


If you want to contribute to light-eventuate or dig into the details on how it works, you have to
clone the project and build on your local.
