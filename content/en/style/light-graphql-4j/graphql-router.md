Graphql Router is responsible for handling GraphQL and GraphiQL requests and hooks schema provider. It provides RouteHandler and SchemaProvider interfaces and implements both GET and POST handlers for GraphQL.

The router is a HandlerProvider, and it needs to be put into the service.yml config file.

This [link][] is an example.

The user developed schema needs to be hooked to the GraphqlPostHandler in this module through SchemaProvider interface. The service.yml config file should include the implementation of the com.networknt.graphql.router.SchemaProvider
