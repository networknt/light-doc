If you want upgrade your application manually to the latest version of light-rest-4j framework, please make sure that the versions match the ones from [pom.xml](https://github.com/networknt/light-rest-4j/blob/master/pom.xml).

It is highly recommended to regenerate your application with the latest [light-codegen](https://github.com/networknt/light-codegen) and compare with you current application to leverage new features from the new release.
