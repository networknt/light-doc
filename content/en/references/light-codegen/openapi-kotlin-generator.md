This generator is based on the OpenAPI 3.0 specification, and it is a new specification that is supposed to replace Swagger 2.0 specification. It has some significant changes to enhance the spec definition and simply the validate with only JSON schema. In my opinion, it is much easier to use, and the implementation is much simpler then Swagger 2.0. OpenAPI adds a number of features as well. The only issue I can see is the entire toolchains around Swagger 2.0 are not migrated to OpenAPI 3.0 yet, and we have to build our own [openapi-parser][] for parsing and validation.

## Input

#### Model

In light-rest-4j framework generator, the model that drives code generation is the OpenAPI 3.0 specification previously named Swagger specification. When editing it, it usually will be in YAML format with separate files for readability and flexibility. Before leverage it in the light-rest-4j framework, all YAML files need to be bundled to a single file in YAML or JSON format to be consumed by the framework and generator. Also, validation needs to be done to make sure that the openapi.yaml or openapi.json is valid against JSON schema of OpenAPI 3.0 specification.

Note: we only support OpenAPI 3.0 specification for Kotlin.

- [OpenAPI Bundler][] - A command line tool to combine multiple yaml specifications into one

In most cases, developers will only update handlers, handler tests, and models in a generated project. Of course, you might need a different database for your project, and we have a [database tutorial] that can help you to further config Oracle and Postgres.   

Given we have most of our model and config files in [model-config][] repo, most generator input would come from the rest folder in model-config for the light-rest-4j framework.

Let's clone the project to your workspace as we will need it in the following steps. I am using `~/networknt` as a workspace, but it can be anywhere in your home directory.

```
cd ~/networknt
git clone https://github.com/networknt/model-config.git
```


## Usage

#### Java Command line

Before using the command line to generate the code, you need to check out the light-codegen repo and build it. I am using `~/networknt` as the workspace, but it can be anywhere in your home directory.  

```
cd ~/networknt
git clone https://github.com/networknt/light-codegen.git
cd light-codegen
mvn clean install
```

* YAML Model

The default format for OpenAPI 3.0 specification is YAML. Given we have test `openapi.yaml` and `config.json` in light-rest-4j/src/test/resources folder, the following command line will generate a RESTful  API at `/tmp/openapi-yaml` folder.

Working directory: light-codegen

```
cd ~/networknt/light-codegen
java -jar codegen-cli/target/codegen-cli.jar -f openapikotlin -o /tmp/openapi-yaml -m light-rest-4j/src/test/resources/openapi.yaml -c light-rest-4j/src/test/resources/config.json
```

After you run the above command, you can build and start the service:
```
cd /tmp/openapi-yaml
./gradlew clean build run
```

To test the service from another terminal:
```
curl http://localhost:8080/server/info
```


The above example use local OpenAPI specification and config file. Let's try to use files from github.com:

Working directory: light-codegen

```
rm -rf /tmp/openapi-petstore
cd ~/networknt/light-codegen
java -jar codegen-cli/target/codegen-cli.jar -f openapikotlin -o /tmp/openapi-petstore -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/networknt/model-config/master/rest/openapi/petstore/1.0.0/openapi.json -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/networknt/model-config/master/rest/openapi/petstore/1.0.0/config.json
```

Please note that you need to use a raw URL when accessing GitHub files. The above command line will generate a petstore service in /tmp/openapi-petstore.

Given we have most of the model and config files in the model-config repo, most generator input would from the rest folder in model-config. Here is the example to generate petstore. Assuming model-config is in the same workspace as light-codegen.

Working directory: networknt

```
rm -rf /tmp/openapi-petstore
cd ~/networknt
java -jar light-codegen/codegen-cli/target/codegen-cli.jar -f openapikotlin -o /tmp/openapi-petstore -m model-config/rest/openapi/petstore/1.0.0/openapi.json -c model-config/rest/openapi/petstore/1.0.0/config.json
```

#### Docker Command Line

Above local build and command line utility works but it is very hard to use that in DevOps script. To make scripting easier, we have dockerized the command line utility.

The following command is using docker image to generate the code into /tmp/light-codegen/generated:

```
docker run -it -v ~/networknt/light-codegen/light-rest-4j/src/test/resources:/light-api/input -v /tmp/light-codegen:/light-api/out networknt/light-codegen -f openapikotlin -m /light-api/input/openapi.json -c /light-api/input/config.json -o /light-api/out/generated
```
On Linux environment, the generated code might belong to root:root and you need to change the owner to yourself before building it.

```
cd /tmp/light-codegen
sudo chown -R steve:steve generated
cd generated
./gradlew clean build run
```

To test it.

```
curl localhost:8080/v1/pets/111
```

#### Docker Scripting

You can use docker run command to call the generator, but it is very complicated for the parameters. To make things easier and friendlier to DevOps flow. Let's create a script to call the command line from a docker image.

If you look at the docker run command you can see that we basically need one input folder for schema and config files and one output folder to generate code. Once these volumes are mapped to a local directory and with framework specified, it is easy to derive other files based on
convention.

```
cd model-config
./generate.sh openapikotlin ~/networknt/model-config/rest/openapi/petstore/1.0.0 /tmp/petstore
```
Now you should have a project generated in /tmp/petstore/genereted

#### Codegen Site

The service API is ready. We are working on the UI with a generation wizard.
