**Upgrade guidelines:**
There are several changes for this release and some of them are not backward compatible. First the database script has been changed so you have to recreate the database if you are no using docker compose. Second, the service type has been changed from ms/api to openapi/swagger/graphql/hybrid for the enum values.
