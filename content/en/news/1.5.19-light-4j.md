**Upgrade Guidelines:**

This release added more features and fixed several bugs. It should be backward compatible for most existing services. Just update the pom.xml version should work from previous release 1.5.18. If you are in an older version, please follow the guideline to upgrade to 1.5.18 first or just regenerate your project with the latest light-codegen. 

- Several modules are renamed with two words and they are all optional modules. If you are using them, please update the pom.xml in the dependencies section. They are basic-auth, rate-limit, deref-token email-sender, and data-source.
- A new module http-string is created with all the Undertow HTTP headers. This is extracted from the utility module to remove the dependency of Undertow from the utility. If you see some HTTP Header cannot be resolved, please add this into the dependencies. 
- A typo is fixed in the HashUtil and this utility used internally most of the case. 
- ip-whitelist is a new security middleware handler. It will be used for /health to ensure requests are from Consul cluster. 
- multiple chains defined in handler.yml is the recomended way to handle middleware handlers instead of service.yml file. For more info on how to config it, please see example at https://github.com/networknt/light-example-4j/tree/master/middleware-performance
