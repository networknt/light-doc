## [1.5.20](https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/tree/1.5.20) (2018-10-05)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/compare/1.5.19...1.5.20)

**Fixed bugs:**

- MiddlewareHandler.register is called for each endpoint [\#305](https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/issues/305)

**Closed issues:**

- Handler needs to properly escape characters in the Status description [\#306](https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/issues/306)
- provide default security.yml and move providerId to jwt.yml [\#304](https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/issues/304)
- Indicate that the BufferSize is too small in client.yml if Body cannot be parsed [\#302](https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/issues/302)
- Intermittent issues with Consul API discovery [\#301](https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/issues/301)
- make bufferSize configurable for default buffer pool in Http2Client [\#299](https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/issues/299)
- Add more debug info during startup for the Kubernetes status.hostIP [\#297](https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/issues/297)
- Update the config module output to error only when config file not found [\#294](https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/issues/294)
- Update OAuthHelper to include new method to support SAML grant type flow [\#290](https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/issues/290)
- server does not create zip file from config server correctly [\#157](https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/issues/157)

**Upgrade Guidelines:**

- This is a release to fix defects and add features so it is backward compatible. Just update the version in your pom.xml should work. 
- The bufferSize has been added to the client.yml config file for Http2Client if the request body is bigger than 24KB which is the default if it is not set.
- A default security.yml for JwtHelper is included in the security module. To enable or disable Jwt verification and scope verification can be done by both security.yml or framework specific security config like openapi-security.yml
