This release [1.5.4](https://github.com/networknt/light-rest-4j/releases/tag/1.5.4) adds OpenAPI 3.0 specification support. 

* [OpenAPI 3.0 support][] - The OpenAPI specification was release on July this year and some of our
customers have been asking to support it. Now light-rest-4j has three middleware handlers that work
with OpenAPI 3.0 specification. The older Swagger 2.0 is still supported with slight changes to the
[light-codegen][] as framework name has been changed from light-rest-4j to swagger and the new OpenAPI
3.0 generator framework is openapi. If you want to use OpenAPI 3.0 specification for your project, please
refer to [OpenAPI 3.0 Petstore Tutorial][].
