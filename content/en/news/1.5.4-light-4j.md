This release [1.5.4](https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/releases/tag/1.5.4) adds several enhancements. 

* [Server Plugins Configuration][] - Previously, all the plugins are loaded by Java SPI and it cannot
be externalized or overwritten. To give developer more flexibility to put in mock handler for their
testing and switch handler on production for debugging etc. We have moved the configration to our own
service module which is configed by service.yml file. This requires existing application to update
service.yml to add entries and remove META-INF folder. You can refer to the petstore example at https://github.com/networknt/light-example-4j/tree/master/rest/swagger/petstore


* [Service Config with Generic Type][] - This is an enhancement for service module to load individual
instance with a generic type. It is used in our OpenAPI 3.0 specification [openapi-parser][] to load
validators for each model class. You an read [service tutorial][] to learn how to use it. 

  

* [Add Constant for OpenAPI 3.0 Support][] - As OpenAPI 3.0 and Swagger 2.0 are supported at the same
time in light-rest-4j in this release. We have separate the two with two different set of middleware
handlers. Also, the constant used are different in order to make sure developers are not confused.
