This release [1.5.5](https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/releases/tag/1.5.5) adds several enhancements. 

This release is backward compatible and you can just update your pom.xml version from 1.5.4 to 1.5.5 for
your current project. However, to take advantages of this release there are certain configuration files need
to be updated. 

* If you are using client module, you should make some change to connect to light-oauth2 server with https
The example of client.yml can be found at https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/blob/master/client/src/main/resources/config/client.yml

* security.yml has been changed to add a new config entry bootstrapFromKeyService and default value is false.
The example of security.yml can be found at https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/blob/master/security/src/main/resources/config/security.yml 
And [here](https://doc.networknt.com/tutorial/security/bootstrap-from-key-service/) is a tutorial to learn how to use this feature.

* service module has been refactored to allow POJO to be injected instead only interface and implementations.
also you can manually inject beans into the service map for debugging. There is a [tutorial](https://doc.networknt.com/tutorial/common/service/) that show how to use these features. 

* secret.yml password or client_secret can be encrypted with customized encryption utility and decryptor class. 
A [tutorial](https://doc.networknt.com/tutorial/security/encrypt-decrypt/) shows all the steps to utilize it if your company has policy to prevent clear text password in config files. 

* Full client callback functions are provided so that you can have exceptions in the called to be propagated to the caller thread. Also, the response time is returned for metrics collection. The source code can be found at https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/blob/master/client/src/main/java/com/networknt/client/Http2Client.java#L615 and an test case to show you how to use it at https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/blob/master/client/src/test/java/com/networknt/client/Http2ClientTest.java#L367

* cors.yml has been updated to add some comments and there is an updated [tutorial](https://doc.networknt.com/tutorial/cors/) on how to use it.
