## [1.5.9](https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/tree/1.5.9) (2018-02-21)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/compare/1.5.8...1.5.9)

**Closed issues:**

- Support dynamic port binding for Kubernetes hostNetwork [\#162](https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/issues/162)
- switch light-config-server connection to HTTP 2.0 [\#159](https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/issues/159)

**Merged pull requests:**

- update to latest Develop branch [\#160](https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/pull/160) ([chenyan71](https://github.com/chenyan71))

**Upgrade Guide:**

- The service module has been enhanced to support dynamic port allocation and self registration on Kubernetes cluster. The following section has been added to the server.yml config file. If you are not using the feature, you don't need to include the block. This change is backward compatible. Example can be found at https://github.com/networknt/light-example-4j/blob/master/discovery/api_a/kubernetes/src/main/resources/config/server.yml

There is [Kubernetes tutorial](https://doc.networknt.com/tutorial/common/discovery/kubernetes/) on how to use it as part of the service registry and discovery.

```
# Dynamic port is used in situation that multiple services will be deployed on the same host and normally
# you will have enableRegistry set to true so that other services can find the dynamic port service. When
# deployed to Kubernetes cluster, the Pod must be annotated as hostNetwork: true
dynamicPort: false

# Minimum port range. This define a range for the dynamic allocated ports so that it is easier to setup
# firewall rule to enable this range. Default 2400 to 2500 block has 100 port numbers and should be
# enough for most cases unless you are using a big bare metal box as Kubernetes node that can run 1000s pods
minPort: 2400

# Maximum port rang. The range can be customized to adopt your network security policy and can be increased or
# reduced to ease firewall rules.
maxPort: 2500

```
