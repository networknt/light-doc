## [1.5.19](https://github.com/networknt/light-rest-4j/tree/1.5.19) (2018-09-22)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/networknt/light-rest-4j/compare/1.5.18...1.5.19)

**Closed issues:**

- openapi-validator doesnot validate enum values from the specification [\#56](https://github.com/networknt/light-rest-4j/issues/56)
- upgrade to the new open-parser api for openapi-validator [\#54](https://github.com/networknt/light-rest-4j/issues/54)
- switch to http-string module for HttpString headers constants [\#53](https://github.com/networknt/light-rest-4j/issues/53)
- Error parsing openapi spec when objects depend on eachother [\#52](https://github.com/networknt/light-rest-4j/issues/52)
- support YAML format for the specification in OpenAPI framework [\#51](https://github.com/networknt/light-rest-4j/issues/51)

**Merged pull requests:**

- Implements OpenApiEndpointSource and SwaggerEndpointSource which â€¦ [\#55](https://github.com/networknt/light-rest-4j/pull/55) ([logi](https://github.com/logi))

**Upgrade Guidelines:**

- A defect in OpenAPI 3.0 validator is fixed and this can cause a previously passed validation test case fails. 
- You can use openapi.yaml for light-codegen now and the same file will be used at runtime. If only validation changes for the spec, just copy it to the application config.
- The security.yml and validator.yml should be renamed to swagger-security.yml, swagger-validator.yml, openapi-security.yml and openapi-validator.yml for future proof. The generic files are still working.
