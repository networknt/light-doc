The light-4j application can be easily started as Unix/Linux services using either init.d or systemd given it is packaged as a fatjar. 

## Installation as an init.d service (System V)

If your application is packaged as a fatjar, and you’re not using a custom script, then your application can be used as an init.d service. Simply symlink the jar to init.d to support the standard start, stop, restart and status commands.

The script supports the following features:

* Starts the services as the user that owns the jar file
* Tracks application’s PID using /var/run/<appname>/<appname>.pid
* Writes console logs to /var/log/<appname>.log

Assuming that you have a light-4j application installed in /var/myapp, to install the application as an init.d service, simply create a symlink:

```
sudo ln -s /var/myapp/myapp.jar /etc/init.d/myapp
```

Once installed, you can start and stop the service in the usual way. For example, on a Debian based system:

```
service myapp start
```

You can also flag the application to start automatically using your standard operating system tools. For example, on Debian:

```
update-rc.d myapp defaults <priority>
```

### Securing an init.d service

When executed as root, as is the case when the root is being used to start an init.d service, the default executable script will run the application as the user which owns the jar file. You should never run a light-4j application as root so your application’s jar file should never be owned by root. Instead, create a specific user to run your application and use chown to make it the owner of the jar file. For example:

```
chown bootapp:bootapp your-app.jar
```

In this case, the default executable script will run the application as the bootapp user.

To reduce the chances of the application’s user account is compromised, you should consider preventing it from using a login shell. Set the account’s shell to /usr/sbin/nologin, for example.

You should also take steps to prevent the modification of your application’s jar file. Firstly, configure its permissions so that it cannot be written and can only be read or executed by its owner:

```
chmod 500 your-app.jar
```

Secondly, you should also take steps to limit the damage if your application or the account that’s running it is compromised. If an attacker does gain access, they could make the jar file writable and change its contents. One way to protect against this is to make it immutable using chattr:

```
sudo chattr +i your-app.jar
```

It will prevent any user, including root, from modifying the jar.

User root is used to control the application’s service, and you use a .conf file to customize its startup, the .conf file will be read and evaluated by the root user. It should be secured accordingly. Use `chmod` so that only the owner can read the file and use `chown` to make root the owner:

```
chmod 400 your-app.conf
sudo chown root:root your-app.conf
```

### Externalize Configuration

For production deployment, you need to externalized your configuration to a folder so that it can be easily updated. 

Update your command line to add -Dlight-4j-config-dir=/etc/yourappconfig

Please follow [config][] module document for details on how config files are loaded. 

### Forward Port 443

As the process is running with a non-root user, there is no way that you can bind the port 443. Please follow this tutorial to upddate iptables to [redirect 443 to 8443][] on your VM.
