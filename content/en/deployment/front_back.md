Light-* frameworks are designed to conduct microservices, yet most services will be consumed by either mobile native application on devices or single page application on browsers. 

Here is the best practice in managing the project with both a front and back end.

### Put both the front end code and back end code into the same repo on git. 

* Reduced the number of repos on git
* Easy to link front and backend together.
* Avoided version mismatch issues
* Code can be generated by light-codegen in one shot.
