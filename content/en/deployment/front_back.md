The light-* frameworks are designed to do microservices but most services will be consumed 
by either mobile native application on devices or single page application on browsers. 

Here is the best practice to manage the project with both font and back end.

### Put both front end code and back end code into the same repo on git. 

* Reduced the number of repos on git
* Easy to link front and backend together.
* Avoid version mismatch issue
* Code can be generated by light-codegen in one shot.
