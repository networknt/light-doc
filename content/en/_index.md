title: "A High Throughput, Low Latency and Small Memory Footprint API Platform"
date: 2017-03-02T12:00:00-05:00
features:
  - heading: Blistering Speed and Small Memory Footprint
    image_path: /images/icon-fast.svg
    tagline: Save 10x to 100x on production provision costs
    copy: You need hundreds of instances of Spring Boot with Tomcat embedded to match one instance of light-4j in "Hello World" for the same throughput and latency.

  - heading: Embedded Gateway to Address all Cross-cutting Concerns
    image_path: /images/icon-content-management.svg
    tagline: Maximize developers productivity by focusing on business logic only
    copy: Plugin architecture that allows middleware handlers to be injected into the request/response chain to handler security, metrics, audit etc.

  - heading: Design and Test Driven Development
    image_path: /images/icon-shortcodes.svg
    tagline: OpenAPI specification, Unit, Integration, End-to-End and Client Tests
    copy: Generate code from specification and encourage unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end test as well as client tests to ensure quality and interoperability.

  - heading: Built-in DevOps Tool Chain for CI/CD
    image_path: /images/icon-built-in-templates.svg
    tagline: Light-bot pipeline, Ansible playbook, Docker and Kubernetes
    copy: The entire tool chain (pipeline) and infrastructure (logging, metrics, messaging, security etc.) are integrated together for microservices and services are dockerized and orchestrated by Kubernetes.

  - heading: Multi-Style Support for Different Products
    image_path: /images/icon-multilingual2.svg
    tagline: Both synchronous request/response and asynchronous event driven frameworks
    copy: Support Restful(light-rest-4j), Graphql(light-graphql-4j), Hybrid(light-hybrid-4j) and Eventuate Consistency(light-eventuate-4j). Also Saga(light-saga-4j) for transaction orchestration between services.

  - heading: OAuth2, Portal and Services to Form an Ecosystem
    image_path: /images/icon-custom-outputs.svg
    tagline: Provide a platform for on-premise solutions as well as hosted solutions
    copy: light-oauth2 for security and light-portal is for service runtime monitoring and management and API marketplace. Kafka for messaging, ELK for logging, InfluxDB and Grafana for metrics and ArangoDB for DB.

    copy: "OAuth2 provider is responsible for centralize policy management and services are responsible for policy enforcement. Portal is API management and marketplace. Others are third party services."
  - heading: "Tool Chains"
    cta: Tool chain for code generation, devops and CI/CD.
    link: /tool/
    color_classes: bg-primary-color-light black
    image: /images/home-page-templating-example.png
    copy: "Light-codegen is used for scaffolding project from OpenAPI spec, GraphQL IDL or Hybrid Schema. Light-bot Pipeline for building, packaging, releasing and dockerizing. Kubernetes is for service orchestration."
