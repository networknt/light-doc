title: "A High Throughput, Low Latency and Small Memory Footprint API Platform"
date: 2017-03-02T12:00:00-05:00
features:
  - heading: Blistering Speed and Small Memory Footprint
    image_path: /images/icon-fast.svg
    tagline: Save 10x to 100x on production provision costs
    copy: You need hundreds of instances of Spring Boot with Tomcat embedded to match one instance of light-4j in "Hello World" for the same throughput and latency.

  - heading: Embedded Gateway to Address all Cross-cutting Concerns
    image_path: /images/icon-content-management.svg
    tagline: Maximize developers productivity by focusing on business logic only
    copy: Plugin architecture that allows middleware handlers to be injected into the request/response chain to handler security, metrics, audit etc.

  - heading: Design and Test Driven Development
    image_path: /images/icon-shortcodes.svg
    tagline: OpenAPI specification, Unit, Integration, End-to-End and Client Tests
    copy: Generate code from specification and encourage unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end test as well as client tests to ensure quality and interoperability.

  - heading: Built-in DevOps Tool Chain for CI/CD
    image_path: /images/icon-built-in-templates.svg
    tagline: Light-bot pipeline, Ansible playbook, Docker and Kubernetes
    copy: The entire tool chain (pipeline) and infrastructure (logging, metrics, messaging, security etc.) are integrated together for microservices and services are dockerized and orchestrated by Kubernetes.

  - heading: Multi-Style Support for Different Products
    image_path: /images/icon-multilingual2.svg
    tagline: Both synchronous request/response and asynchronous event driven frameworks
    copy: Supports Restful(light-rest-4j), Graphql(light-graphql-4j), Hybrid(light-hybrid-4j), and Eventuate Consistency(light-eventuate-4j), as well as Saga(light-saga-4j) for transaction orchestration between services. 

  - heading: OAuth2, Portal and Services to Form an Ecosystem
    image_path: /images/icon-custom-outputs.svg
    tagline: Provide a platform for on-premise solutions as well as hosted solutions
    copy:  light-oauth2 is for security while light-portal is for service runtime monitoring and management and the API marketplace. Kafka is for messaging, ELK is for logging, InfluxDB and Grafana are for metrics, and ArangoDB is for DB.

    copy: "Light-4j and related frameworks provide dozens of middleware handlers that can be injected into the request/response chain to give your service an embedded gateway." 
  - heading: "Interaction Styles"
    cta: Use the right framework for the right product.
    link: /architecture/category/
    color_classes: bg-primary-color-light black
    image: /images/home-page-templating-example.png
    copy: "Restful is for public APIs, Graphql is for mobile and Single Page Applications, while Hybrid for serverless. It takes advantage of both Monolithic and Microservices architecture. Eventuate is for event-driven applications."
  - heading: "Infrastructure Services"
    cta: OAuth2, Portal and other infrastructure services.
    link: /service/
    color_classes: bg-primary-color-light black
    image: /images/home-page-templating-example.png
    copy: "The OAuth2 provider is responsible for centralizing policy management and services which are responsible for policy enforcement. Portal is for API management and the marketplace. Others are third party services."
  - heading: "Tool Chains"
    cta: Tool chain for code generation, devops and CI/CD.
    link: /tool/
    color_classes: bg-primary-color-light black
    image: /images/home-page-templating-example.png
    copy: "Light-codegen is used for scaffolding projects from OpenAPI spec, GraphQL IDL or Hybrid Schema. Light-bot Pipeline is for building, packaging, releasing and dockerizing. Kubernetes is for service orchestration."
