In microserivces architecture, one request might trigger multiple services in the call stack
and to ensure that data consistency between services, we have provided light-saga-4j to
manage distributed transactions. Sagas require your services to be idempotent and provide
compensation action for each update action. light-saga-4j is built on top of light-eventuate-4j.
