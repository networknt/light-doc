Another way to start a brand new project is to copy from one of the existing examples. You can find several Restful API examples at [light-example-4j][] repository and the majority of them has a [tutorial][] to walk you through step by step. If you are interested in implementing your service in Kotlin, you can find examples in [light-example-kotlin][] repository. 

[light-example-4j]: https://github.com/networknt/light-example-4j/tree/master/rest
[light-example-kotlin]: https://github.com/networknt/light-example-kotlin/tree/master/openapi
[tutorial]: /tutorial/rest/
