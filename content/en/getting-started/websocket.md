HTTP protocol is pretty efficient especially HTTP 2.0; however, to handle repeated
communication between server to browser or between browser to browser, nothing can
complete with web socket. Once the connection is established, the communication
channel is open until it is close. It is very efficient to handler messages or
events in an event driven application.
