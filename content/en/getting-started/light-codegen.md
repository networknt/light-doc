The code generator [light-codegen][] could be used to support project scaffolding for all the frameworks provided by the light platform.

The code generator based on Rocker template engine that can be used as a utility or web service. It is used currently as scaffold services which include [light-rest-4j][], [light-graphql-4j][],  [light-eventuate-4j][] and [light-hybrid-4j][].

### Workflow

Light-codegen generates initialized microservice project based on user-defined specification and configuration file:

-- Light-rest-4j

  for OpenAPI based generation:  OpenAPI JSON/YAML format specification and configuration file

  for Swagger based generation:  Swagger JSON format specification and configuration file

-- Light-graphql-4j

  GraphQL IDL for service logic and configuration file


-- Light-hybrid-4j

   Hybrid service JSON based RPC schema definition file and configuration file


-- Light-eventuate-4j (rest API service)

   OpenAPI JSON/YAML format specification which includes the specification for both CQRS command side service and query side service and configuration file
