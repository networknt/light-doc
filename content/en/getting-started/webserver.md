Most people use Light to build services instead of web servers; however, todayâ€™s Mobile Native applications and Single Page applications running on browsers makes the traditional server side rendering provided by Java EE obsolete. For your browsers and mobile devices you need a web server that can serve Javascript with static content as well as APIs. This is the strength of Light.
