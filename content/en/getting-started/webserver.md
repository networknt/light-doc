Most people use light platform to build services instead web server; however, today's
Mobile Native application and Single Page application running on browser makes the traditional
server side rendering provided by Java EE obsolete. For your browsers and mobile devices
you need a web server that can serve Javascript with static content as well as APIs. This
is the strength of light platform.
