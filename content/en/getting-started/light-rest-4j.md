The light-rest-4j is a framework that is designed to speed up RESTful API development and deployment. On top of light-4j, it has several middleware handlers specifically designed around Swagger 2.0 and OpenAPI 3.0 specifications. With the specification ready, you can scaffold project with [light-codegen][], and the specification will be loaded during the runtime to enable JWT scope verification and schema validation for the request based on the spec.
