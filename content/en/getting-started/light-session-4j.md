Most people think Light is only for services as it is our forte. However, it can be used to build web applications that support Mobile Native and Single Page applications. To provide Single Sign-On and High availability, we need to support multiple instances of server running and session replication among them. Light-session-4j is designed for this and it supports in-memory, Hazelcast, Redis and JDBC for session replication.
