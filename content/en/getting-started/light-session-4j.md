Most people think light platform is only for services as we are very good at it. However, it
can be used to build web applications that support Mobile Native and Single Page applications.
To provide Single Sign-On and High availability, we need to support multiple instances of
server running and session replication among them. Light-session-4j is designed for this and it
support in-memory, Hazelcast, Redis and JDBC for session replication.
