React is the most popular Javascript library for Single Page Applications. It is very good at building components which encapsulate everything inside.

Internally, we are using React for almost all Web interfaces for various services.  To speed up the development we also developed [react-schema-form][] which can generate forms and logic to interact with backend services in a unified way. 

[react-schema-form]: /consumer/react-schema-form/
