Along with React, Angular is another Javascript framework to build Single Page Applications. There are a lot of users who have built Angular SPA and access backend services/APIs built on top of the light platform. When there are multiple services in the backend and these services are deployed to the cloud, light-router will be used as a single access point for the SPA. The light-router is also responsible for serving the SPA to eliminate the dependency of CORS middleware handler on the light-router instance to gain better performance.
