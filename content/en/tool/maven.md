In this tutorial, we are going to show you how to install Maven on Ubuntu server. 

First you need to go to apache.org to find out the url to the latest Maven bin.tar.gz

The current version is 

http://apache.mirror.rafal.ca/maven/maven-3/3.5.2/binaries/apache-maven-3.5.2-bin.tar.gz 

```
cd /usr/local
sudo wget http://apache.mirror.rafal.ca/maven/maven-3/3.5.2/binaries/apache-maven-3.5.2-bin.tar.gz
sudo tar xvf apache-maven-3.5.2-bin.tar.gz

```

Now, let's update .bashrc file under your home directory to export environment variables.

```
export M2_HOME=/usr/local/apache-maven-3.5.2
export M2=$M2_HOME/bin
export PATH=$M2:$PATH
```

Save the file and run

```
source .bashrc
```

To verify if Maven is installed successfully. 

```
mvn -version
```
