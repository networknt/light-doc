One of the design principles of `light-4j` frameworks is to make each Lego piece smaller so that developers have the flexibility to compose their services with just enough functionality and smaller memory footprint/smaller delivery package. As you can see, most light-4j cross-cutting modules only have about five Java classes on average, and we have a lot of modules to manage.

It is even more complicated since we support different [style of interaction][] for microservices and we have to create several frameworks as different customers are using a different framework.

It has a significant negative impact on package management, testing and release process as there are a lot more moving pieces. Every time we have a release of frameworks, there are at least two days in testing to make sure that everything works together. 

We have been looking at DevOps tools on the open source world to streamline our process, but all of the tools are not designed for us. They are focusing on a single repository monolithic app only as most of them build a single project by putting a config file in the repository. Before we decide to build our own light-bot, we have spent countless hours on Jenkins and try to make it work for our [repositories][] and one customer who has dozens of microservices finally gave up. Here is a list of [Jenkins issues][] and I think other DevOps tools have these issues in common. 

We need an automation tool that can handle multiple repositories with dependencies for our packages, and at the same time, our customers are asking for a similar tool to manage their microservices once the numbers are increasing. 

This forces us to consider building our own DevOps tool [light-bot][]  

To start a full-blown DevOps toolchain is not an easy job and we are starting from the command line first and will add a central control server and agent server later on. 

Another goal for this light-bot project is to try Gradle with [Kotlin DSL][]. As you know, light-4j frameworks are built with Maven, and I have been looking at Gradle for a while but don't want to learn Groove DSL. With release 4.4.1, the Kotlin DSL is good enough for production usage, and I am trying it with the light-bot project. So far everything works perfectly, and it is really fast compared with Maven build. The next step is to update light-codegen to give user option to choose Maven or Gradle in the config.json file.

To build the project, just run "./gradlew build" in the root folder of [light-bot][].
