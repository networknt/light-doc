This is a generator that scaffolds hybrid services which is on top of light-hybrid-4j and light-4j
frameworks. Hybrid framework contains a set of handlers to support RPC style of contract instead
of Restful to eliminate the complex transformation between model and URI and vice verse. Currently
we only support JSON RPC and binary RPC will be supported if there are requests. Another benefit
of the hybrid framework is that services can be composed as a modular monolith and running within the
same JVM in the beginning and then split them into several JVM later on if load is getting higher.

It is very suitable for small and medium size business as you can start microservices without
the huge front end infrastructure investment. 

## Input

#### Model

As light-hybrid-4j is an RPC based framework, only HTTP POST method is used. Currently, only JSON based RPC is
implemented and binary formatted protocol will follow. 

Here is an exmaple of schema that defines several services. 

```json
{
  "host": "lightapi.net",
  "service": "world",
  "action": [
    {
      "name": "hello",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "handler": "HelloWorld1",
      "scope" : "world.r",
      "schema": {
        "title": "Service",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "firstName": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "lastName": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "age": {
            "description": "Age in years",
            "type": "integer",
            "minimum": 0
          }
        },
        "required": ["firstName", "lastName"]
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "hello",
      "version": "0.1.1",
      "handler": "HelloWorld2",
      "scope" : "world.r",
      "schema": {
        "title": "Service",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "firstName": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "lastName": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "age": {
            "description": "Age in years",
            "type": "integer",
            "minimum": 0
          }
        },
        "required": ["firstName", "lastName"]
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "hi",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "handler": "HiWorld",
      "scope" : "world.r",
      "schema": {
        "title": "Service",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "firstName": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "lastName": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "age": {
            "description": "Age in years",
            "type": "integer",
            "minimum": 0
          }
        },
        "required": ["firstName", "lastName"]
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "welcome",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "handler": "WelcomeWorld",
      "scope" : "world.w",
      "schema": {
        "title": "Service",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "firstName": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "lastName": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "age": {
            "description": "Age in years",
            "type": "integer",
            "minimum": 0
          }
        },
        "required": ["firstName", "lastName"]
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

## Usage

#### Java Command line

You can [download or build][] the codegen-cli command line jar. 

This is a generator that scaffolds a service module that will be hosted on a light-hybrid-4j server
platform as a jar file. Multiple modules can be hosted on the same server if needed and they can
interact with each other through a module interface/contract defined by schema files. The generated
project cannot run directly as it's only a small jar file without a main class. However its services are
enabled by placing the jar file into the classpath of the server. For multiple jar files, we recommend
creating a folder like /service or /lib within the class path of the server and having it contain all
necessary light-hybrid-4j services.

The following will generate a sample light-hybrid-4j service which exposes a hello-world endpoint.
Working directory: light-codegen
```
java -jar codegen-cli/target/codegen-cli.jar -f light-hybrid-4j-service -o /tmp/hybridservice -m light-hybrid-4j/src/test/resources/schema.json -c light-hybrid-4j/src/test/resources/serviceConfig.json
```

Now we have a server and a service generated. Let's go through deploying the service and starting the server.

First let's build the **service** and copy the jar file into the **server** folder:
```
cd /tmp/hybridservice
mvn clean install
cp target/petstore-1.0.1.jar /tmp/hybridserver
```

Now let's build the **server** and start it while including the above **service** in its classpath:
```
cd /tmp/hybridserver
mvn clean install
java -cp petstore-1.0.1.jar:target/petstore-1.0.1.jar com.networknt.server.Server
```

Let's use curl to test one of the services:
```
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/api/json \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'postman-token: 58bb63eb-de70-b855-a633-5b043bb52c95' \
  -d '{
  "host": "lightapi.net",
  "service": "world",
  "action": "hello",
  "version": "0.1.1",
  "lastName": "Hu",
  "firstName": "Steve"
}'
```

#### Docker Command Line

The following command is using docker to generate light-hybrid-4j service into
/tmp/light-codegen/hybridservice folder

```
docker run -it -v ~/networknt/light-codegen/light-hybrid-4j/src/test/resources:/light-api/input -v /tmp/light-codegen:/light-api/out networknt/light-codegen -f light-hybrid-4j-service -m /light-api/input/schema.json -c /light-api/input/serviceConfig.json -o /light-api/out/hybridservice
```

In the Linux environment, the generated code might belong to root:root and you need to change the
owner to yourself before building it. 

Let's change the owner and build the service

```
cd /tmp/light-codegen
sudo chown -R steve:steve hybridservice
cd hybridservice
mvn clean install

```

To run the server with services, please following the instruction in utility command line.

#### Docker Scripting

```
git clone git@github.com:networknt/model-config.git
cd model-config
./generate.sh light-hybrid-4j-service ~/networknt/model-config/hybrid/generic-service /tmp/hybridservice
```

Now you should have a project generated in /tmp/hybridservice/generated

#### Codegen Site

You can generate single project or multiple projects from the site https://codegen.lightapi.net with your model and config files.
