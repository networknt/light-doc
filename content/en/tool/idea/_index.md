Most of our developers are using IntelliJ IDEA as IDE for the platform develop or application development. The community edition is free and it is more than enough for our users. 

To install it, please download it from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download

While using the IDE, we found some tricks that might help other users. 

* [Add jars to the classpath](/tool/idea/classpath/)
* [IntelliJ IDEA settings](/tool/idea/settings/)
* [Error Prone Plugin](/tool/idea/errorprone-plugin/)
