The current light platform is built on top of Java 8, and we are planning to support Java 11 very soon once the dependencies are ready. During the development, we have to switch between Java 8 and Java 10 / 11 when working with different git branches. 

The Sdkman from [sdkman.io](https://sdkman.io) is a crucial tool we are relying on. 

To install the tool, please refer to the [installation page](https://sdkman.io/install). 

For usage info, please refer to [usage page](https://sdkman.io/usage).
