This document will give you step-by-step guidelines on how to use light-codegen which is an in-house generator to support all API frameworks/styles in the Light platform and beyond.
  
All frameworks in the Light platform are design-driven, and you can scaffold a new project based on the IDL (Interface Definition Language) with light-codegen.
