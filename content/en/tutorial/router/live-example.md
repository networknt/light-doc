As all our services are built with light-4j frameworks, we don't need to use light-router instances for service to service communication. We do use light-router to support the SPA and mobile applications from the Internet. 

Here are two production sites that use two light-router instances to share all the backend services. 

https://lightapi.net
https://maproot.net

The test sites can be accessed from the following links.

https://dev.lightapi.net
https://dev.maproot.net


Both sites are using the light-router to serve the single-page applications, handle the security and single sign-on. 

If you are a customer who has difficulty setting up a light-router instance, we can configure one on our cloud environment or your cloud provider. Our managed router instance can also access light-portal services with a small monthly fee only when the request exceeds certain numbers.
