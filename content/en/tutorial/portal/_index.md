When light-portal is deployed, there might not be a lot of volume in the beginning. We will be using only one hybrid-command server to host all the services that update the portal and one hybrid-query server to host all the services that only read info from the portal. Each server can be scaled to multiple instances based on the read-only load or write-only load. Also, we have an option to move one or two hot services to a separate server instance and scale it accordingly later on.

Most services for portal can be found in the [light-portal][] repository on github.com/networknt. The UI can be found in [view][] folder and the UI final version is deployed to the [light-config-test][] repository on github.com/networknt.
