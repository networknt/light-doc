In the previous [debug with hybrid server][] tutorial, we have tried to put the user-query service in the hybrid-query server and use the JUnit test in the user-command service to debug the interaction between these two services. In this tutorial, we are going to run both user-query and user-command in servers within two IDE sessions. Instead of triggering the event with JUnit tests, we are going to use Postman to issue a request to either the query side or the command side.

### Environment

Please follow the [unit test tutorial][] to set up the local environment. 

### Long-lived Token

If you need a long-lived token for your test cases or command line, you can use the token in the [unit test tutorial][].

### Debug

In this session, we are going try the user registration and email confirmation from the Postman. 

Here is a vedio walkthrough.
