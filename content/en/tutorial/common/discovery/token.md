## Introduction

In previous steps, we have set up Consul with acl_default_policy=allow so that all operations to the Consul server are allowed. This should be only used for internal testing. For official environments, we must set acl_default_policy=deny while having all operations to the Consul server provide an acl_token in the header.

Now let's copy our previous state from `tag` to `token` for each API:
 
```bash
cp -r ~/networknt/discovery/api_a/tag ~/networknt/discovery/api_a/token
cp -r ~/networknt/discovery/api_b/tag ~/networknt/discovery/api_b/token
cp -r ~/networknt/discovery/api_c/tag ~/networknt/discovery/api_c/token
cp -r ~/networknt/discovery/api_d/tag ~/networknt/discovery/api_d/token
```

## Starting Consul

If you consul server is still running, please stop it and restart it with the following:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8400:8400 -p 8500:8500/tcp -p 8600:53/udp -e 'CONSUL_LOCAL_CONFIG={"acl_datacenter":"dc1","acl_default_policy":"deny","acl_down_policy":"extend-cache","acl_master_token":"the_one_ring","bootstrap_expect":1,"datacenter":"dc1","data_dir":"/usr/local/bin/consul.d/data","server":true}' consul agent -server -ui -bind=127.0.0.1 -client=0.0.0.0
```

The above command will ensure the default policy is to deny access, and configure the master ACL token so that services which have the token can register.

## Configuring Consul

Create agent token

```bash
curl \
    --request PUT \
    --header "X-Consul-Token: the_one_ring" \
    --data \
'{
  "Name": "Agent Token",
  "Type": "client",
  "Rules": "node \"\" { policy = \"write\" } service \"\" { policy = \"read\" }"
}' http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/acl/create
```

And we get the token like this.

```json
{"ID":"67ccac85-36a3-e912-d0b3-bce1194119a0"}
```

Introduce the token through an API.

```bash
curl \
    --request PUT \
    --header "X-Consul-Token: the_one_ring" \
    --data \
'{
  "Token": "67ccac85-36a3-e912-d0b3-bce1194119a0"
}' http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/agent/token/acl_agent_token
```

And let's give anonymous users read permissions.

```bash
curl \
    --request PUT \
    --header "X-Consul-Token: the_one_ring" \
    --data \
'{
  "ID": "anonymous",
  "Type": "client",
  "Rules": "node \"\" { policy = \"read\" } service \"\" { policy = \"read\" }"
}' http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/acl/update
```

It should return something like this:

```json
{"ID":"anonymous"}
```

## Configuring the Servers

The next step we are going to update `secret.yml` to add consul-token in order to access the Consul for service registry and discovery.

For each server, go ahead and update `secret.yml` to add consulToken: `the_one_ring`

```yaml
consulToken: the_one_ring
```

## Starting the servers

Now let's start four terminals to start servers.  

**API A**

```bash
cd ~/networknt/discovery/api_a/token
mvn clean install -DskipTests exec:exec
```

**API B**

```bash
cd ~/networknt/discovery/api_b/token
mvn clean install -DskipTests exec:exec
```

**API C**

```bash
cd ~/networknt/discovery/api_c/token
mvn clean install -DskipTests exec:exec
```

**API D**

And start the first instance that listen to `7444` as default

```bash
cd ~/networknt/discovery/api_d/token
mvn clean install -DskipTests exec:exec
```

Now you should be able to see the registered service from the Consul UI.

```bash
http://localhost:8500/ui
```

In this step, we secured our consul access from services so that we can be sure that the services registered on the consul are the valid ones. In the next step, we are going to start services with [Docker][] containers.
