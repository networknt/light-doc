Services typically need to call one another. In monolithic applications, services invoke one another through language-level method or procedure calls. In a traditionally distributed system deployment, services run at fixed, well-known locations (hosts and ports) and so can easily call one another using HTTP/REST or some RPC mechanism. However, a modern microservice-based application typically runs in a virtualized or containerized environments where the number of instances of a service and their locations (IP and port) changes dynamically.

This tutorial shows how to use the service registry and discovery feature of the light platform to discover services and invoke it with the client module.
