The service module is very flexible and powerful as you can combine all the above use
cases together to create composite use cases. Take a look at the generated service.yml
from our [light-codegen][] and you an see that we are using it to inject plugins all
over the places.

There are a lot more [test cases][] in service module and it is a good place to start to
learn it.
