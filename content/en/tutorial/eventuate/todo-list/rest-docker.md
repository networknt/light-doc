Let's copy docker config folder to the todo-list folder from the existing one.

```
cd ~/networknt/light-example-4j/eventuate/todo-list
cp -r ../todo-list.bak/docker .

```

There are two sub-folders in the docker module:

### command-service

Since the service runs in the docker container, we need to change the MySQL hostname to use docker image name:

service.yml:

```yaml
- javax.sql.DataSource:
  - com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource:
      DriverClassName: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
      jdbcUrl: jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/eventuate?useSSL=false
      username: mysqluser
      password: mysqlpw

```

To create and publish the rest-command docker image. 

```
./build.sh 1.5.13
```


### query-service

Since the service runs in the docker container, we need to change the MySQL hostname and Kafka hostname to use docker image name:

service.yml:

```yaml
- javax.sql.DataSource:
  - com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource:
      DriverClassName: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
      jdbcUrl: jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/todo_db?useSSL=false
      username: mysqluser
      password: mysqlpw

```

kafka.yml:

```yaml
bootstrapServers: kafka:9092

```

To create and publish the rest-query docker image. 

```
./build.sh 1.5.13
```

### Start command side and query side service from docker compose

Instead of start service from the command line, start service from docker compose file:

```
cd ~/networknt/light-example-4j/eventuate/todo-list
docker-compose up

```

Now we can follow the same steps in [rest test][] to verify the service result from with curl commands.

In the next step, we are going to [dockerize the hybrid services][].
