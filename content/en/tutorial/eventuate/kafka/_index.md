Kafka is used a message broker in our event driven frameworks like light-eventuate-4j, light-tram-4j and
light-saga-4j. During development, we normally use Kafka in Docker container along with Zookeeper container
and it makes debugging and monitoring a little bit complicated. This section contains several tutorials to
show users how to debug and monitor Kafka, Zookeeper and resolve issues when it is not working as expected.
