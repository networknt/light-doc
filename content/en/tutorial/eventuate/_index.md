The light-eventuate-4j framework is complex than any request/response based framework like light-rest-4j, light-graphql-4j or light-hybrid-4j as there are more moving parts. In this
section, we are going to introduce some tutorials to help users to work with this framework.

Before starting a service project based on light-eventuate-4j, you need to get the environment set up first, and the [getting started light-eventuate-4j][] has all the information to help you to get infrastructure services started. 

Once you have your environment set up, the first tutorial is [todo-list][] which is a hello world type of application to demonstrate how to build two microservices on command side and query side based on Event Sourcing and CQRS. 

Todo-list is a simple application that demonstrates the features of light-eventuate-4j with Event Sourcing and CQRS. Although it is very simple, it is utilizing all the parts of the eventuate framework. It helps the developer to focus on the flow of the eventuate framework instead of complex business logic. If you want to see a full-blown business application, then you can refer to [account management tutorial][].

* [todo-list][]
* [account management tutorial][]

To help users to grasp other parts of the framework we have the following tutorials to focus each difficult areas. 

* [Kafka Tutorial][] helps to work with Kafka in Docker container.
* [Test Tutorial][] helps users to write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
* [Developer's Tutorial][] guidelines for developers who are working on the framework or services
