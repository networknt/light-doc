Now let's see if these servers are performing with
[wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk). To learn how to use it, please see my
article in tools [here][]

Assume you have wrk installed, run the following command.

```
wrk -t4 -c128 -d30s http://localhost:7001 -s pipeline.lua --latency -- /v1/data 1024

```
And here is what I got on my i5 desktop

```
wrk -t4 -c128 -d30s http://localhost:7001 -s pipeline.lua --latency -- /v1/data 1024
Running 30s test @ http://localhost:7001

```

Before starting the next step, please kill all four instances by Ctrl+C. And check in
the httpchain folder we just created and updated.
