If you are using the [Http2Client][] for the service to service communication, you need to include all client related modules into your pox.xml file. You can find these modules from [light-consumer-4j][] which is a convenient fat client that packages all consumer side modules together. 

If you are working with an original client, you'd better use the light-consumer-4j instead of including all modules individually. light-consumer-4j also implement retry and circuit breaker to further guarantee the connectivity to the APIs/services. 

This dependency will include the submodules required to support client consumption of an API like service discovery, load balancing, oauth2 integration, etc.

## Maven

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.networknt</groupId>
    <artifactId>light-consumer-4j</artifactId>
    <version>1.5.20</version>
</dependency>
```
