We are using light-kafka and light-hybrid-4j for light-portal, light-blockchain and open-banking applications with Event Sourcing and CQRS, so it is easier for us to provide examples with hybrid framework. As a lot of our users are still using light-rest-4j, so we want to provide an additional example in REST.
