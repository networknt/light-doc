We have a lot of tutorials that demonstrate different features of the light platform. More and more users ask if we can provide a more realistic tutorial that combines all aspects of microservices development and deployment. 

In this tutorial, we are going to develop an open banking application and deploy it to the cloud. This application has four microservices and a single page application built with React.
