One of the benefits utilizing microservices architecture is to make sure
your application is easily scaling. When we talk about scalability, one 
of the best books is [The Art of Scalability](http://theartofscalability.com/)

It introduced the scale cube as following. 

![scale_cube](/images/app_scale.png)

The Scale Cube consists of an X, Y and Z axes – each addressing a 
different approach to scale a service. The lowest left point of the 
cube (coordinates X=0, Y=0 and Z=0) represents the worst case 
monolithic service or product identified above: a product wherein 
all functions exist within a single code base on a single server making 
use of that server’s finite resources of memory, cpu speed, network 
ports, mass storage, etc.

In this model, scaling an application by running clones behind a load 
balancer is known as X-axis scaling. The other two kinds of scaling are 
Y-axis scaling and Z-axis scaling. The microservice architecture is an 
application of Y-axis scaling but let’s also look at X-axis and Z-axis 
scaling.

## X-axis scaling

X-axis scaling consists of running multiple copies of an application 
behind a load balancer. If there are N copies then each copy handles 
1/N of the load. This is a simple, commonly used approach of scaling 
an application.

One drawback of this approach is that because each copy potentially 
accesses all of the data, caches require more memory to be effective. 
Another problem with this approach is that it does not tackle the 
problems of increasing development and application complexity.

## Y-axis scaling
Unlike X-axis and Z-axis, which consist of running multiple, identical 
copies of the application, Y-axis axis scaling splits the application 
into multiple, different services. Each service is responsible for one 
or more closely related functions. There are a couple of different ways 
of decomposing the application into services. One approach is to use 
verb-based decomposition and define services that implement a single use 
case such as checkout. The other option is to decompose the application 
by noun and create services responsible for all operations related to a 
particular entity such as customer management. An application might use 
a combination of verb-based and noun-based decomposition.

## Z-axis scaling
When using Z-axis scaling each server runs an identical copy of the code. 
In this respect, it’s similar to X-axis scaling. The big difference is 
that each server is responsible for only a subset of the data. Some 
components of the system are responsible for routing each request to the 
appropriate server. One commonly used routing criteria is an attribute 
of the request such as the primary key of the entity being accessed. 
Another common routing criteria is the customer type. For example, an 
application might provide paying customers with a higher SLA than free 
customers by routing their requests to a different set of servers with 
more capacity.

Z-axis splits are commonly used to scale databases. Data is partitioned 
(a.k.a. sharded) across a set of servers based on an attribute of each 
record. In this example, the primary key of the RESTAURANT table is used 
to partition the rows between two different database servers. Note that 
X-axis cloning might be applied to each partition by deploying one or 
more servers as replicas/slaves. Z-axis scaling can also be applied to 
applications. In this example, the search service consists of a number 
of partitions. A router sends each content item to the appropriate 
partition, where it is indexed and stored. A query aggregator sends 
each query to all of the partitions, and combines the results from each 
of them.

Z-axis scaling has a number of benefits.

Each server only deals with a subset of the data. This improves cache 
utilization and reduces memory usage and I/O traffic. It also improves 
transaction scalability since requests are typically distributed across 
multiple servers. Also, Z-axis scaling improves fault isolation since a 
failure only makes part of the data in accessible.

Z-axis scaling has some drawbacks.

One drawback is increased application complexity. We need to implement a 
partitioning scheme, which can be tricky especially if we ever need to 
repartition the data. Another drawback of Z-axis scaling is that doesn’t 
solve the problems of increasing development and application complexity. 
To solve those problems we need to apply Y-axis scaling.
