In today's IT strategy and architecture, APIs are the new frontier. No matter what industry you are in, doing business
digitally is the way to go and APIs are an essential part of the digital transformation. As an API platform provider,
we have worked with many companies who are building APIs and implementing API management. All of them seems traveling
a similar path as the kind of challenges they are facing are all most the same. 

From these cases, we have so far categorized five distinct stages of API adoption. Different people might have different
criteria but the overall course is very similar. We just want to share our experience and hopefully help you lead your
API initiative in the right direction. 

### Stage 1: API Awareness - Monolith 

In the first stage of API adoption, APIs get simply introduced as a lightweight method of application integration. 
Often, we see integration needs of mobile applications as the first targets. In a mobile-first approach, APIs are 
simply served from existing monolithic application. For example, existing Java EE application exposes RESTful API 
through JAX-RS. In other words, APIs at this stage are designed to make life simple for app developers and driven by
developers. It greatly increases the development efficiency and significantly speeds-up the overall process, which in 
turn makes product owners happy. And so, the infections quickly spread. 

As APIs are purely driven by mobile applications or single page applications at this stage, there is no active architecture
and design but just modify the traditional web application to expose API in order to speed up the UI development. As the
monolithic platform does not have any built-in features to support API, all cross-cutting concerns will be addressed at
the network level with a commercial API gateway.  

### Stage 2: API Platform Architecture - Modularized Monolith

Once the benefits of APIs are firmly established, you are likely to start thinking about different kind of concerns and
turn to vendors for their API technologies. With more updates to the APIs driven by the business, you start to realize
that simply modifying the existing application cannot keep up to speed as deploying monolithic app is painful and risky. 

You have heard about microservices architecture but cannot go that way as the initial infrastructure cost is too high and
building distributed application is too complicated for the team without experience. Naturally, you would want to separate
your APIs to smaller modules and deployed to the same application server with multiple wars or ears in Java EE platform. 
This gives you the flexibility to develop and deploy individual module independently to meet the ever-changing business
requirement. 

More and more commercial API management tools might be adopted at this stage as more concerns need to be addressed. For
example, security, rate limiting, policy management, etc. are all need to be considered when more and more APIs are
exposed.  

### Stage 3: API Management - Entry Level Microservices

The more successful your APIs, the more users for your APIs and gradually the monolith API cannot scale to handle the
volume anymore. At this stage, you are seriously considering microservices architecture and start to redesign some of the
high load APIs to microservices. These microservices are independently developed, deployed, scaled and only focus on
a single functionality. They might still share the same database between different microservices and existing monolith.

From API management perspective, you might start thinking to have centralized logging, auditing, and metrics. You might
consider to dockerize these APIs deploy them into the cloud orchestrated by Kubernetes. 

### Stage 4: Advanced API Management - Medium Level Microservices 

When you have more and more APIs running, you start to realize that API management becomes a daunting task. Shared database
tightly couples several APIs together and hinders developers to make changes. The single database is broken up
and each service has its own database. 

API management and infrastructure services become mature and effective. Security, logging, metrics, auditing are all
addressed and most services are running in Kubernetes cluster. You are starting to explore another style of APIs like GraphQL
or RPC.  

### Stage 5: API First - High-Level Microservices

When there are too many update microservices running within the organization, you soon realized that the synchronous
request/response would not work all the time and your application might be broken due to unreliable network and leave data
inconsistent between services. You start to investigate eventual consistency and start to adopt the event-driven asynchronous
approach to manage communication between services. Event Sourcing and CQRS will be used in certain applications and Saga
pattern will be used to manage distributed transactions between multiple update services. At this stage, service to
service communication mainly done through events and client to service interaction can be RESTful, GraphQL and RPC as
well as message, command or event. 

API management is done through a customized portal to for the life cycle of APIs and API marketplace will link the consumers
to providers. The entire API ecosystem is running organically and more and more APIs add to the system. New
application development becomes very easy as most building blocks are available to be reused. 

### Final note

The API era is still fresh and developing rapidly. Consequently, we are far from certain that the fifth stage will be the 
final stage. Some people saying that the end stage would be serverless but nobody knows what is going to happen in a 
couple of years. 

Where are you currently on your API adoption journey? Still in the early stages, or running in the front? Maybe already 
beyond the fifth stage? No matter what stage you are in, light platform provide frameworks, infrastructure services, and 
toolchains to help you with your API journey.
