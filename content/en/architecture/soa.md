Some of people ask, “isn’t microserivces architecture just another name for SOA?”  
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) sprung up during the first few years of this 
century, and microservice architecture (abbreviated by some as MSA) bears a number 
of similarities. Traditional SOA, however, is a broader framework and can mean a 
wide variety of things. Some microservices advocates reject the SOA tag altogether, 
while others consider microservices to be simply an ideal, refined form of SOA.  
In any event, we think there are clear enough differences to justify a distinct 
“microservice” concept.
 
The typical SOA model, for example, usually has more dependent ESBs, with 
microservices using faster messaging mechanisms. SOA also focuses on imperative 
programming, whereas microservices architecture focuses on a responsive-actor 
programming style. Moreover, SOA models tend to have an outsized relational database, 
while microservices frequently use NoSQL or micro-SQL databases (which can be 
connected to conventional databases). But the real difference has to do with the 
architecture methods used to arrive at an integrated set of services in the first 
place. 
 
Since everything changes in the digital world, agile development techniques that 
can keep up with the demands of software evolution are invaluable. Most of the 
practices used in microservices architecture come from developers who have created 
software applications for large enterprise organizations, and who know that today’s 
end users expect dynamic yet consistent experiences across a wide range of devices.  
Scalable, adaptable, modular, and quickly accessible cloud-based applications are in 
high demand. And this has led many developers to change their approach.
