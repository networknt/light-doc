When using light-4j and its related frameworks, most developers are working on handlers, and most of these handlers are business handlers instead of [middleware handlers]. Business handlers are the ultimate handler in the request/response chain, and it is responsible for processing the request and producing the response by applying the business logic.

When using other frameworks except for light-4j, you can leverage [light-codegen][] to scaffold your project based on the specification(OpenAPI 3.0, GraphQL IDL or Hybrid Schema, etc.) All business handler classes, as well as test classes for the business handlers, will be generated in the project for developers to fill in business logic and test assertion. 

For business handler examples, you can visit the OpenAPI 3.0 [Petstore application][] generated by the [light-codegen][] in the [light-example-4j][] repository.
