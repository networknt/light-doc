When you have service to service communications between microservices, HTTPS is a must, and we have both client and server [keystore and truststore][] to support one-way TLS or two-way TLS. 

For most developers, manipulating keystore and truststore with [keytool][] would be new for them. If it is not working, turn on the network debugger would help a lot. 

Just put the following line into the VM options in the run/debug configurations window to enable the net debugging. 

```
-Djavax.net.debug=all
```

[keystore and truststore]: /tutorial/security/keystore-truststore/
[keytool]: /tool/keytool/
