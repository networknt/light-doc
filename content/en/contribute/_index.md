### Overview

Light relies heavily on the enthusiasm and participation of the open-source community. We need your support in its [development][], [documentation][], [example][], and [tutorial][]. In addition to above activities, opening issues on github.com and asking questions on gitter rooms helps the team improve the products and helps other members learn how to use the platform.

Light contains a list of open-source projects and lives by the work of its contributors. There are plenty of open issues in each repository, and we need your help to make Light even more remarkable. You do not need to be a guru to contribute to the projectâ€™s development. If you are a new developer that needs help with git and development tools, please visit [GitHub Help][].


### GitHub Organization

Over the years, we have developed several hundreds of projects scattered in several GitHub organizations and provided Git servers. Most of them are open-sourced to the public, while some are only open-sourced to the customers. Only a small number of repositories are closed-sourced and worked on by the internal team members.

Here is a list of GitHub organizations that contains open-source repositories.
