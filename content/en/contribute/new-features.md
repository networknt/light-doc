### New Features

* For a new feature, an RFC is needed for background information. It helps the team to understand the use cases, the design and implementation ideas. The document is the base for the discussion, and it will be the raw material for the documentation once the feature is released. 

* Create a pull request in [light-rfcs](https://github.com/networknt/light-rfcs) repository with the [template.md](https://github.com/networknt/light-rfcs/blob/master/template.md). The most important information in the RFC are the use cases and the rationale for the new feature. 

* Assign the PR to people who are responsible for the particular area or leave it empty for the team members to pick it up. At least two reviewers must review an RFC before merged. 

* As we have too many repositories, one of the reviewers needs to outline where the issue or issues need to be created.  

* Final approver adds “approved-pending-issues” label on the RFC to ensure that corresponding issue(s) must be created to address it.

* The RFC opener creates an issue with the label “help wanted” in associated repositories and link the issue to the RFC for reference information. 

* For high priority RFCs, please notify the team members through emails or slack channels. Each team has its backlog and reviews the priority on a weekly basis. 

* Team members will self assign the issues they intend to address from the list of "help wanted" issues that are unassigned.
