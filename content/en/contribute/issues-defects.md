### Issues and defects

* For defects or issues, create a GitHub issue first and discuss with the community before sending a pull request. This is to prevent duplicate work and confirm if alternative options are available. 

* If the issue opener wants to work on the issue, please self assign it so that other people won't pick up the same issue. Otherwise, please label the issue as "help wanted". 

* Community members will discuss and prioritize the issues and assign them to developers.
