In order to follow the steps below, please make sure you have the same working 
environment. As this tutorial is targeted to Java developers and I assume you have
the knowledge to work on a Java project on your personal computer. For people who
are not Java developer, you can have Docker installed and pull the running image
from Docker Hub to try the service created in this tutorial. 


* A computer with MacOS or Linux (Windows should work but I never tried)
* Install git
* Install Docker
* Install JDK 8 and Maven
* Install Java IDE (Intellij IDEA Community Edition is recommended and it is free)
* Create a working directory under your user directory called networknt.

```
cd ~
mkdir networknt
```

Once your environment is ready, go to the next step to [create a Swagger specification file][].
